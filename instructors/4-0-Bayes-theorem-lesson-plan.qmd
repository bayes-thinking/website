**Objective:** 

- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand the concept of Bayes' Theorem, its historical context, and its applications in probability and statistics.

**Duration:** 

- About 60 minutes

**Materials:**

- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts with exercises and problems related to Bayes' Theorem
- Projector and screen

**Introduction:**

- Begin the lesson with a question to engage students: "Have you ever wondered how we make decisions based on uncertain information?" 
- Discuss a few examples, like medical diagnoses, weather forecasts, or financial decisions.

**Introduce the lesson's topic:** 

- Bayes' Theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory that helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

**Historical Context:**

- Bayes' Theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English statistician, philosopher, and theologian.
- Thomas Bayes never published his work on the theorem during his lifetime. It was discovered in his notes after his death and published posthumously.
- Story of Thomas Bayes:
    - Thomas Bayes was born in 1701 and is believed to have been largely self-educated in mathematics and logic.
    - He became a Presbyterian minister, and his interests in theology and mathematics intersected in intriguing ways.
    - While not widely known during his lifetime, his work laid the foundation for modern probability theory.

**Main Content:** Bayes' Theorem

**Basic Probability Concepts:**

- Define key terms: prior probability, posterior probability, likelihood, evidence, and conditional probability.
- Provide examples to illustrate these concepts, such as rolling dice or drawing cards from a deck.

**Understanding Bayes' Theorem:**

- Present the formula for Bayes' Theorem:
$$ \text{P}( A | B ) = \frac{\text{P}( B | A ) \text{P}(A)}{\text{P}(B)} $$

- Discuss how Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs about an event $A$ given new evidence $B$.

**Applications of Bayes' Theorem:**

- Medical diagnosis (e.g., disease testing)
- Criminal investigations (e.g., DNA evidence)
- Spam email filtering
- Weather forecasting

**Calculation and Practice:**

- Guide students through solving example problems using Bayes' Theorem.
- Distribute handouts with exercises and problems for individual or group work.

**Discussion and Wrap-Up:**

- Facilitate a class discussion to review the example problems and reinforce key concepts.
- Ask students about their thoughts on how Bayes' Theorem can be applied in their daily lives or in other fields of study.

**Homework:**

- Assign additional problems from the textbook or handouts to reinforce the understanding of Bayes' Theorem.

**Formative Assessment:**

- Evaluate students based on their participation in discussions, their ability to solve example problems, and their performance on the assigned homework.

**Conclusion:**

- Let students summarize the importance of Bayes' Theorem in making informed decisions under uncertainty. 
- Encourage students to explore further applications and study advanced topics in probability and statistics.
