(Calculus approach could be done depending on the math prerequisite of the course.)\n-   Compute and label incomplete axes with values utilizing their understanding that the area of all probability distributions is equal to one.\n\n## **Getting Started:**\n\n**Duration:** - 75 minutes\n\n**Materials:**\n\n-   Handouts with exercises and problems\n-   Computer, projector, and screen\n-   whiteboard and markers\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nBegin class with the *Notice and Wonder* activity. State the objectives of the lesson. Then, give a brief historical connection.\n\n## **Notice and Wonder:**\n\nHave students look at two probability distributions and ask them what they notice about the graphs and what they wonder. If students have never done this type of activity, you will need to provide a longer wait time for the students to respond. Be accepting of all responses.\n\n:::: {layout=\"[ 50, 50 ]\"}\n\n::: {#first-column}\n\n![](Images_in_my_qmd_files/N_&_W1.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: {#second-column}\n![](Images_in_my_qmd_files/N_&_W2.png)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n<font color = \"red\">**Sample Student Response:**\n\nBoth graphs have the year on the x-axis. Both graphs have the same scale on the y-axis. The right graph is a darker color. Both graphs have the same number of bars. The graph on the left has the bars touching. The left graph is a histogram, and the right is a bar graph. I wonder if the right graph is a bar graph because it looks like both axes are quantitative. Maybe someone will think that the left graph can graph continuous data and the right graph is discrete data. I wonder what this graph is counting in each of the years. There is no title, and the y-axis is not labeled.\n</font>\n\n## **Historical Context:**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![Girolamo Cardano](Images_in_my_qmd_files/cardano.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nGirolamo Cardano was a 16th-century Italian professor of mathematics and medicine, but he was also a gambler. He could have been the father of probability if his work had been published when he first recorded his ideas. Instead, his work was published centuries later. He was perhaps the first to think about assigning a number from 0 to 1 to the probability of an outcome.\n:::\n:::\n\n## **Jakob Bernoulli**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n![Jakob Bernoulli](Images_in_my_qmd_files/Jakob_Bernoulli.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\nThis was lucky for Jakob Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician, who then received the credit for introducing the idea of representing complete certainty as one and probability as a number between zero and one with his publication of Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713).\n:::\n:::\n\n## **Main Content:**\n\nA **probability distribution** is a statistical function describing the probability (likelihood) of obtaining all possible values a [random variable]{.underline} can take. Typically, we use graphs or tables as visual representations of probability distributions.\n\nThere are *two types of probability distributions* based on the two types of random variables: discrete and continuous. \n\n![Figure 5 Overview of Probability Distributions](Images_in_my_qmd_files/Prob_distribution_overview.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## **Discrete Random Variable**\n\nA discrete random variable,X, has possible values that can be given in an ordered list. The **probability mass function** is the *probability distribution* p~i~ of X lists the values and their given probabilities.\n\nThe probabilities p~i~ must satisfy two requirements:\n\n1.     Every probability p~i~ is a number on the interval \\[0,1\\].\n\n2.     p~1~+p~2~+p~3~ ... = 1\n\n\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {.tg {width: auto !important;}.tg col {width: auto !important;}.tg-wrap {overflow-x: auto;-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;margin: auto 0px;}}</style>\n<div class=\"tg-wrap\"><table class=\"tg\">\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">Value of X</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">x1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">x2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">x3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">…</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">Probability</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">p1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">p2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">p3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><span style=\"color:black\">…</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n\n\n## **Discrete Random Variable: Example 1:**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\nA discrete probability distribution for countries with significant volcanic eruptions can be represented with a bar graph and/or a table.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n![Figure 6 Volcanic Eruptions Worldwide 2000 - 2023](Images_in_my_qmd_files/volcanic_eruptions_2000_2023.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n![](Images_in_my_qmd_files/volcano_data_table.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n\n## **Continuous Random Variable**\n\nA continuous random variable X takes all values in an interval of numbers. A density curve describes the probability distribution of X.  The probability of any event is the area under the density curve and above the values of X that make up the event. \n\n**The total area of a continuous probability distribution is equal to 1**. *Because the probability is equal to the area under the curve, all continuous probability distributions assign a probability of 0 to every individual outcome.  Only intervals of values have a positive probability.*\n\n## **Continuous Random Variable: Normal Distribution**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![Gauss (Wittmann & Oreshina,2009)](Images_in_my_qmd_files/Gauss.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\nA continuous distribution you may be familiar with from the introductory statistics course you had before this course is the **Normal Distribution**.

This function is used when graphing a normal distribution.\n\n**Carl Friedrich Gauss**\n\nSometimes, the Normal distribution is called a Gaussian distribution because Carl Friedrich Gauss invented it.\n:::\n:::\n\n## **Calculation and Practice:**\n\n**Normal Distribution Problem**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[![Figure 8](Images_in_my_qmd_files/Normal%20Distribution.png)](https://blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=so28906&logNo=223067130491)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Question 1:** Based on the graph in Figure 8, what is the probability of having a value between 1 and 2 standard deviations above the mean by looking at the area under the curve for this region. \n\n<font color = \"red\">\n**Solution:** In this case, it is approximately .1359 or 13.59% chance.\n</font>\n\n**Question 2:** What is the probability of having a value between two standard deviations below the mean and one standard deviation above the mean?\n:::\n:::\n\n## Calculation and Practice: Question 2 Solution\n\n::: {layout=\"[ 60, 40 ]\"}\n::: {#first-column}\n![Figure 9: Normal Distribution](Images_in_my_qmd_files/Normal%20Distribution.png){alt=\"Figure 9\"}\n:::\n\n::: {#second-column}\n<p style=\"color: red\">Solution: .1359+ .3413 +.3413 =.8185</p>\n:::\n:::\n\n## Continuous Random Variable: Uniform Distribution\n\n::: {layout=\"[ 60, 40 ]\"}\n::: {#first-column}\n\n![Figure 10](Images_in_my_qmd_files/Uniform_distribution.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#second-column}\n\nAnother common continuous distribution is the **Uniform Distribution (a,b)**.\n\nThe area between a and b is = 1.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Calculation and Practice: Question 3\n\n**Question 3** What is the area of a Uniform (0,1) distribution pictured below?\n\n![Figure 11: Uniform(0,1)](Images_in_my_qmd_files/U_zero_one.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"323\"}\n\n## Calculation and Practice: Question 3 Solution\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n<p style=\"color: red\">Solution: Area of Rectangle = base × height = 1.

This constant could be a scalar value, equation, or function. *Every probability distribution that doesn't sum to 1 will have a normalizing constant.*\n\nSometimes the calculation of the normalizing constant will be easy to compute.
